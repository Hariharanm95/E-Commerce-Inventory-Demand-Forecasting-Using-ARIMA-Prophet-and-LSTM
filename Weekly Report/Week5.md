    *   Configured API requests (using Axios) to fetch products and display them in the UI.
    *   Set up routing using React Router DOM to enable navigation between UI components.
    *   Testing functionality to check for bugs and responsiveness issues.

**Challenges Encountered:**

*   Handling asynchronous API requests and data loading.
